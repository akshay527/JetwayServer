This README file provides the necessary details for accessing measurement results. It is only relevant
to those using the feature.isri.cmu.edu/measurement database for reading and writing test results.

 Measurement:
 
 This database is comprised of several different tables, as outlined below:
 
 1) Configurations - this table consists of the different configurations of options that are available to test.
                     ConfigurationID 
 2) MResults - this table consists of the experiment results written by Jetway Clients.
 3) NFP - this table lists the types of features that are being measured and stored in the database (Time, Power, CPU, etc.).
 4) Program - (unused)
 5) Result - (unused)
 6) Series - this table consists of the different trial numbers and benchmarks upon which experiments have been performed.
             The general format is SERIES_1{a-e}, where SERIES is the series name, and {a-e} are different trial runs.
 7) Todos - this table is used as a queue for Jetway Clients to pull tasks from. Once an experiment in the Todos has been
            performed, the result is written into MResults.

  Data:
  
  The series that are particularly relevant for looking at are kmeans_1*, particle_filter_new_1*, srad_1* because they 
  demonstrate the benefits of multithreading most clearly.
  
  The format for checking a value is a bit difficult to explain, so I will use an example:
  
  EXAMPLE 1 
 
  MySQL Command: "SELECT * FROM MResults WHERE SeriesID = 14 AND NFPID = 40"
  
  NFPID = 40 : Run Power
  SeriesID = 14 : kmeans_1a
  
  OUTPUT = All execution power values and their configurationIDs that have been tested for kmeans_1a:

  ConfigID SeriesID NFPID Value
  377468	14	40	20847.492187
  377271	14	40	17589.179625
  377270	14	40	17874.5587917
  377269	14	40	19256.0434615
  377243	14	40	18426.464575
  ...
  
  EXAMPLE 2
  
  MySQL Command: "SELECT * FROM MResults WHERE SeriesID = 17 AND NFPID = 77"
 
  Notes:
  
  NFPID = 77 : Run Time
  SeriesID = 17 : particle_filter_new_1a
  
  OUTPUT = All run time values and their configurationIDs that have been tested for particle_filter_1a.
  
  ConfigID SeriesID NFPID Value
  372192	17	77	24.16
  372193	17	77	16.91
  372194	17	77	18.73
  372195	17	77	16.02
  372197	17	77	16.94
  ...
  
  Compile-Power = the average power (mW) that the system used during compilation
  Run-Power = the average power (mW) that the system used during execution
  
  Compile-CPU = the CPU utilization (%) that the system used during compilation
  Run-CPU = the CPU utilization (%) that the system used during execution
