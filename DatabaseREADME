This README file provides the necessary details for accessing measurement results. It is only relevant
to those using the feature.isri.cmu.edu/measurement database for reading and writing test results.

 Measurement:
 
 This database is comprised of several different tables, as outlined below:
 
 1) Configurations - this table consists of the different configurations of options that are available to test.
 2) MResults - this table consists of the experiment results written by Jetway Clients.
 3) NFP - this table lists the types of features that are being measured and stored in the database (Time, Power, CPU, etc.).
 4) Program - (unused)
 5) Result - (unused)
 6) Series - this table consists of the different trial numbers and benchmarks upon which experiments have been performed
 7) Todos - this table is used as a queue for Jetway Clients to pull tasks from. Once an experiment in the Todos has been
            performed, the result is written into MResults.
